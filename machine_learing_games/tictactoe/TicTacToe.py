    Attributes
    ----------
    game_matrix : numpy.matrix
        Represents the game field and stores the current game status.
        Every placed game token is inserted here.
    dimension :  int
        Defines how much rows and columns the game_matrix should have.

     Methods
     --------
    put_game_token(game_token_type, position)
        Places a game token with a specified game_token_type at a position on the game_matrix.

    translate_game_token_type(game_token_type)
        Translates either a single character string 'O' or 'X' into a float value,
        because of internal game_matrix representation purposes.

    is_position_free(position)
        Checks if a position on the game_matrix is taken or free.
        Raises a ValueError exception if the given position is not in range of the game_matrix.

    reset_game_matrix_values()
        Resets every game_matrix game token value back to 0.0.

    is_horizontal_victory()
        Checks if any row of the game matrix contains only game tokens from one player,
        without empty or enemy elements.

    is_vertical_victory()
        Checks if any column of the game matrix contains only game tokens from one player,
